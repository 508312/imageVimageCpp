#**STATE OF THE PROJECT**
I work on this project when I have free time so it is not as polished as it can be. 
It is semi-actively being worked on, and there are a few more things I would like to add before distributing.
Refactoring will be done, the most unsatisfied I am with ImageBuilder and how it owns all CompositeImages,
and how "addons" like StatsCounter are initialized from outside.

###**Building**
Feel free to build the project, you will need the following libraries: OpenCV 4.6.0, SDL2 2.28.1, OneTBB. 
The classes folder is src.
I am currently working on this project alone, so I am yet to make a proper way to build the project. 
If you run into any issues contact me.
